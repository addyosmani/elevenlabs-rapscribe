# Rapscribe ðŸŽµ

A React-based audio visualization application powered by ElevenLabs' Scribe model that helps you visualize audio tracks and their transcriptions with high accuracy.

## Features

- Audio visualization using React
- Speech-to-text transcription powered by ElevenLabs' Scribe model
  - Support for 99+ languages with excellent accuracy (< 5% word error rate) for 25+ languages
  - Smart speaker diarization
  - Word-level timestamps for accurate subtitles
  - Auto-tagging of sound events
  - Exceptional handling of high-speed vocals and complex rap lyrics
- Support for multiple audio tracks
- TypeScript support for enhanced type safety
- Modern build system using Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Demo Highlights

This project showcases ElevenLabs' Scribe model's impressive ability to transcribe extremely rapid speech, as demonstrated with Eminem's "Rap God" - a song notorious for its super-fast sections that exceed 6 words per second. Where many speech recognition systems fail with such challenging content, Scribe maintains high accuracy even with the most technically demanding vocal performances.

## Requirements

- ElevenLabs API key (Required for speech-to-text transcription)
- Supported audio formats for transcription (pre-recorded audio only, real-time transcription coming soon)
